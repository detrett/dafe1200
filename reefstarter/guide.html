          <h1 id="guidestart">Artificial Reefs</h1>
          <p>Artificial reefs generally provide a stable growing area for corals, and habitat for fishes and all the
            other organisms that you would find on a natural reef.
            Artificial reefs can be built out of several
            different materials such as concrete, cement, glass
            or steel rebar. The diversity of materials allows reefs to be
            built in all types of shapes or sizes. This
            creates room for design to come into play.</p>
          <p>By highlighting design as a major element of
            artificial reef building, we offer our users
            the opportunity to leave their own personal
            mark while saving the ocean.
            Creating artistic reef structures helps
            migrate tourism, as more people visit these
            structures instead of natural reefs. Tourism
            can be a threat to coral reefs, as accidental
            or intentional damage occurs.</p>

        <h2>How to design your reef with ReefStarter</h2>
        <div class="text">
          <p>There are two ways to do it: You can import
            your own designs into the app or you can build
            them using the built-in designer.</p>

          <p>Once the design has been submitted, it will
            be moderated to ensure that it is suitable as
            a future habitat. We recommend you to visit
            our sources to ensure success. This might be
            a bit frustrating initially, but you will be
            given suggestions to get it right, so do
            not give up!</p>

          <p>To help with this, our designer tool has been
            created with a modular structure. This lets you
            get creative without any concerns by choosing
            from our preselected modules.</p>

        <section class="text-area banner-text">
          <p>Whether you choose to submit your own design,
            you will be able to browse through all the
            submitted designs around the world through the app.
            The map allows you to filter designs by areas and
            to see which areas are most in need of help.</p>

          <p>Once you have found your favorite design, you can
            submit a vote to let us know.
            Choose wisely, you only get one per area!</p>

          <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
          <p>Once per area, you can submit one vote to
            their favorite design.
            By donating to our cause, you strengthen
            your vote and your account. The more you
            donate, the more your vote is worth.</p>

          <p>You can change your vote anytime until the
            cycle of donations is over. Keep checking,
            you might find a new favorite design!
            Once enough donations have been collected
            to build a structure, a winner is selected.</p>

          <p>All designers, voters, donators and of
            course winners, get badges and progress for
            participating in each cycle. Our goal is to
            encourage you to contribute -no matter how much-
            and have something to show off for it.
            All winners will get their own piece of
            creation built and set up to start helping
            reefs recover as well as a special recognition badge.</p>

          <p>After a structure is installed, we also take
            pictures of it and add it to our gallery,
            so you can browser all the past contributions. </p>
