                    <h2>Welcome to Petra's Merch</h2>
                    <p>In Ancient China, rice was the staple crop in the south and wheat in the north, the latter made
                        into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes.
                        Vegetables used to accompany these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions,
                        and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians
                        was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury
                        but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied
                        by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic,
                        radishes, and lettuces.</p>

                    <p>The mainstay of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese,
                        olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat.
                        The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils.</p>

                    <p>Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being
                        mostly low in fat and carbohydrates,
                        but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume
                        plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more
                        portions a day often being recommended.</p>

                    <p>The word vegetable was first recorded in English in the early 15th century. It comes from Old
                        French,</p>

                    <p>The meaning of "vegetable" as a "plant grown for food" was not established until the 18th
                        century.</p>

                    <p>Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce. Commercial cultivars of bananas and pineapples are examples of seedless fruits.
                         Some cultivars of citrus fruits (especially grapefruit, mandarin oranges, navel oranges), satsumas, table grapes, and watermelons are valued for
                          their seedlessness. In some species, seedlessness is the result of parthenocarpy, where fruits set without fertilization. Parthenocarpic fruit set
                           may or may not require pollination, but most seedless citrus fruits require a stimulus from pollination to produce fruit.</p>

                    <p>Seedless bananas and grapes are triploids, and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant that is produced by fertilization,
                         a phenomenon known as stenospermocarpy, which requires normal pollination and fertilization.</p>
